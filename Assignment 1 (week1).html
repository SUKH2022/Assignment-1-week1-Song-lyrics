        <p>Verse 1</p>
        <ul><li>Here comes a wave meant to wash me away</li>
        <li>A tide that is taking me under</li>
        <li>Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say</li>
        <li>My voice drowned out in the thunder</li></ul>
    
        <p>Pre-Chorus</p>
        <ul><li>But I won't cry</li>
        <li>And I won't start to crumble</li>
        <li>Whenever they try</li>
        <li>To shut me or cut me down</li></ul>
    
        <p>Chorus</p>
        <ul><li>I won't be silenced</li>
        <li>You can't keep me quiet</li>
        <li>Won't tremble when you try it</li>
        <li>All I know is I won't go speechless</li>
        <li>'Cause I'll breathe</li>
        <li>When they try to suffocate me</li>
        <li>Don't you underestimate me</li>
        <li>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless</li></ul>
    
        <p>Verse 2</p>
        <ul><li>Written in stone</li>
        <li>Every rule, every word</li>
        <li>Centuries old and unbending</li>
        <li>"Stay in your place"</li>
        <li>"Better seen and not heard"</li>
        <li>But now that story is ending</li></ul>
    
        <p>Pre-Chorus</p>
        <ul><li>'Cause I</li>
        <li>I cannot start to crumble</li>
        <li>So come on and try</li>
        <li>Try to shut me and cut me down</li></ul>
    
        <p>Chorus</p>
        <ul><li>I won't be silenced</li>
        <li>You can't keep me quiet</li>
        <li>Won't tremble when you try it</li>
        <li>All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless</li>
        <li>Let the storm in</li>
        <li>I cannot be broken</li>
        <li>No, I won't live unspoken</li>
        <li>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless</li></ul>
    
        <p>Bridge</p>
        <ul><li>Try to lock me in this cage</li>
        <li>I won't just lay me down and die</li>
        <li>I will take these broken wings</li>
        <li>And watch me burn across the sky</li>
        <li>Hear the echo saying:</li></ul>
    
        <p>Chorus</p>
        <ul><li>I won't be silenced</li>
        <li>Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it</li>
        <li>All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless</li>
        <li>'Cause I'll breathe</li>
        <li>When they try to suffocate me</li>
        <li>Don't you underestimate me</li>
        <li>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless</li></ul>
    
        <p>Outro</p>
        <ul><li>All I know is I won't go speechless, speechless</li></ul>

    <h3>About the Song:</h3>
    <p>Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) is placed under arrest by the new sultan of Agrabah,
        Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). As she's being led away by the guards, she reflects on a lifetime of having 
        men tell her that her opinion is invalid or never wanted. She determines not to stay silent this time, with 
        her kingdom being taken over by a dictator.</p>
    <p>Theme of the song is Female Empowerment.</p>

    <h4>Few words from Naomi Scott on this song:-</h4>
    <p>"It was just about a natural progressionâ€¦ [Jasmine] being outspoken but just pushing those things, making 
        her even more ambitious. In the original scene, she is fighting for the choice to marry who she wants to marry, 
        and in our movie, she is not just fighting for her own rights- she's fighting for everyone. She cares about 
        her kingdom, she wants to be political, she's a leader, and I think that's something that's really important.</p>
